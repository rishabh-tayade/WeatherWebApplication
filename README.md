A Weather Web Application that tells you your current city's weather as well as weather of any city that you search for!
This project uses HTML (file:index.html) for basic structuring of the web components along with CSS (file:style.css) to define styles for the web-page. DOM Manipulation in this project is done using JavaScript(file:index.js) to fetch and render the information that was received from an api call into the webpage.
Please do go through the project and run it and let me know your suggestions! Thankyou! :)
